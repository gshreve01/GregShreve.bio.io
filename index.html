    I graduated from college in 1988 with a BS in computer science from East Tennessee State University.
    We had just missed the use of punch cards from programming, and the IBM computers we used had 512K of memory.
    My first job was programming in Cobol, PL/1, and EasyTrieve (which was considered an advanced reporting language 
    at the time).  We used JCL (job control language) to define our batch jobs where we had to allocate how much 
    space would be used to generate our output.  I hated to be on-call during our 10-day and month-end processing because
    there were always issues.

    I have always tried to keep up with the technology changes, and tried to predict which skill sets would be
    most useful to get the next great job.  I was fortunate to learn HTML and XML relatively early and get a job
    with a .COM company in early 2000 as a front end web developer.  I moved away from front-end development to 
    work on the more complicated back-end systems which were being developed, and have stayed there for the most part.
    My HTML at work these days is based on utilities I develop outputing XML which I translate into HTML using XSLT.
    I am now in a boot camp to learn about data visualization to become a data analyst/engineer as the next step in
    my career.
